      with an ID console.
  SkyratBot:
  - bugfix: Bloody Mary flavor is now accurate to its description.
  - refactor: Spiderlings are now basic mobs, report any complete weirdness/deviation
      from known behavior. They should be a lot more intelligent now though.
  - rscadd: AI Spiderlings are super fragile, but they're also super fast, especially
      when they get into a vent. Once they're in circulation, they could end up everywhere!
      Maybe in the armory, maybe in a locked closet in maintenance. Be sure to be
      vigilant and splat them whenever you can to save the station from a whole lotta
      heartache!
  - bugfix: papers should count cyrillic and other non-ascii characters correctly
      both server and client-side

  Hatterhat:
  - bugfix: People with style meters affixed to their glasses can now do cool flips.
  - spellcheck: Port Tarkon personnel now have their assignment on their IDs properly
      checked. It truly was nothing personnel, kid.
  SkyratBot:
  - bugfix: Pirates summoned through hacking a comms console should actually spawn
      now.
  - bugfix: ' Drying rack spawning a matter bin and circuit board on deconstruction'
  - bugfix: You can't spam open codex cicatrix now.

2023-05-03:
  Hatterhat:
  - spellcheck: The gunsets and crate that hold CMG-2s are now actually labeled CMG-2,
      and not CMG-1. The last vestiges of "C20-r but stationside" continue to fall.
  SkyratBot:
  - admin: Enslaving mobs is now logged in game.log
  - balance: Machines (such as ORM and Techfabs) will no longer unsync from Ore silos

      if it was on hold.
  - bugfix: Style meter parrying works again
  - bugfix: Style meter bar now works correctly with very high style point count
  - bugfix: prosthetic limb quirk will no longer display a prosthetic on your character
      preview because it is buggy and hardly ever matches what you end up getting
      upon spawning
  - code_imp: removing the prosthetic limb quirk will restore your original limb
  - qol: The game now supports export of your preferences into a JSON file! The verb
      (export-preferences) should now be available in the OOC tab of your stat-panel
      if enabled by server operators.
  - server: Exporting player preferences is controlled by a configuration option,
      'FORBID_PREFERENCES_EXPORT'. If you do not wish to let clients access the ftp()
      function to their own preferences file (probably for bandwidth reasons?) you
      should uncomment this or add it to your config somehow.
  - config: Server operators are also able to set the cooldown between requests to
      download the JSON Preferences file via the 'SECONDS_COOLDOWN_FOR_PREFERENCES_EXPORT'
      config option.
